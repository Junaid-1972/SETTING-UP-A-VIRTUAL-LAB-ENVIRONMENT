Setting up a virtual lab environment aligns with the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) PROTECT function, specifically PR.AC (Access Control) and PR.PT (Protective Technology) categories using segmentation, virtualization, and monitoring to protect systems. In ISO/IEC 27001:2022, it maps most closely to Annex A.5 (Organizational Controls) Policies for testing, segregation of environments, and governance of lab use and Annex A.8 (Technological Controls) Covers technical measures like access control, system isolation, secure configurations, and monitoring—all core to virtual labs.
